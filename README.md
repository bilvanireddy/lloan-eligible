Steps to solve machine learning projects
start
data selection
data description : A story of data is all abot and the features present in the data
performing both statistical and graphical data analysis
data tranformation and derivation of new attributes , if necessary
selection of machine learning algorithms based on the patterns observed in EDA
data standardization and normalization
creation of train and test data sets
model training using machine learning algorithms
calculation of model accuracy : both training and testing accuracy
hyper parameter tuning to achieve a better accuracy
saving the created model file
Deployement strategies for model
production deployment and testing
